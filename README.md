## Description

This project demonstrates basic Express.js knowledge. In this project we allow the user to create their own notes in the app. The user can create, update, and delete notes as they choose. 

This project uses a blank 'notes' array as a makeshift database. User generated notes are then pushed into this 'database' and then are dispayed within the app. The user may choose to also delete the notes by removing specified items from the database array.
